Claude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.

RB

so the NEAR AI blockchain protocol is where i want to park Agartha. We seem aligned with our decentralized and privacy focused software . Also The Matrix ai world creator. lets work on the pitch deck maybe next

Edit

Yes, integrating Agartha with NEAR Protocol's AI blockchain would align well with the ecosystem's decentralized, privacy-focused vision. NEAR's sharding technology and developer-friendly environment could provide the scalable infrastructure needed for Agartha's components. The Matrix AI world creator could enhance the immersive aspects of both Weedland and the Music Machine.

Let's develop a pitch deck. Would you like me to create an initial draft focusing on:

1. The problem/solution narrative  
2. Market opportunity  
3. Technical integration with NEAR and Matrix  
4. Revenue model and tokenomics  
5. Team/Vision/Roadmap  
6. Investment opportunity
